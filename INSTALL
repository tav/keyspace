Building Keyspace
=================

In order to build Keyspace, you will need

1. gcc, the GNU C++ compiler,
2. GNU make and 
3. the BerkeleyDB C++ library.

To install these, issue the following command:

- Debian 4.0 
	
	$ sudo apt-get install g++ make libdb4.4++-dev

- Debian 5.0 

	$ sudo apt-get install g++ make libdb4.6++-dev

- Fedora 10

	$ sudo yum install gcc-c++ db4

- Mac OS X 10.4, 10.5 & 10.6

	Install the Developer Tools from the MacOS DVD.
	Use a port system such as MacPorts or Fink to install Berkeley DB.

	$ sudo port install db46

- FreeBSD 7.2

	$ cd /usr/ports/databases/db; sudo make install

- OpenBSD 4.5

	$ export PKG_PATH=ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.5/packages/`machine -a`

	$ pkg_add -i db
	
	Select from the interactive menu.

- Windows (XP, 2003 Server, Vista, 2008 Server, Windows 7)

	There is a Visual Studio project file included which can be used with the
	freely downloadable Visual C++ Express 2008 or later.
	
	For obtaining Berkeley DB, you can use the prepackaged zip file from the
	Scalien website which contains the necessary include and lib directories,
	and also the precompiled Keyspace and client test binaries.
	
- Other systems

	Edit Makefile.Linux (or Makefile.Darwin) accordingly; 
	modify INCLUDE and LDPATH according to the location of Berkeley DB in 
	your system.

After you have set up the neccessary components, you can proceed to
build Keyspace:

- Linux, Mac OS:

	$ make

- BSD:

	$ gmake

This will create the Keyspace binary 'keyspace' (or 'Keyspace.exe' 
on Windows) in the 'bin' folder.

If something went wrong, try 'make clean' before recompiling.


Running Keyspace
================

To launch Keyspace, start it with the included safe script
located at script/safe_keyspaced. On Windows the script is 
located at script/safe_keyspaced.cmd.

Usage:

	$ script/safe_keyspaced [binary-file] [config-file] [database-dir]

E.g.

	$ script/safe_keyspaced bin/keyspaced test/0/keyspace.conf test/0

If you do not specify a conf file, Keyspace will start in single
mode with default configuration. This is a convenience feature
for new users to get started quickly.

See the next section 'Configuration options' for more information
on the keyspace.conf file.

If you want to run more than one instances on the same computer:

	$ script/safe_keyspaced bin/keyspaced test/1/keyspace.conf test/1

	$ script/safe_keyspaced bin/keyspaced test/2/keyspace.conf test/2

The safe script relaunches Keyspace when a crash occurs or something bad
happens. If you want to stop Keyspace, kill the keyspaced process and
the safe script will terminate too.


Configuration options
=====================

This is a list of possible options in keyspace.conf. You *have* to
specify 'paxos.endpoints' and 'paxos.nodeID', the rest is optional.
We recommend you start out with the default configuration files and
modify them to suit your setup.

For numeric values you may use the K, M, G suffices that mean 1024, 
1024^2, 1024^3 respectively.

- paxos.endpoints

	List of host:port pairs. REQUIRED.
	This value must be the same on all nodes and define the
	Keyspace nodes forming the replicated system. If you only list
	one node, you are running in single-mode, without replication.
	
	Example: 192.168.0.1:10000, 192.168.0.2:10000, 192.168.0.3:10000 

	The nodes use 4 consecutive port numbers for Paxos related 
	protocols, starting with the values defined here. (These are 
	different than the ports you define below such as http.port, see
	Firewall & ports info)

- paxos.nodeID
	
	Number. REQUIRED.
	This must be different on all nodes. The first node's ID is 0,
	the second's is 1 and so on. If you are running in single-mode, put 0 here.

- io.maxfd

	Number. OPTIONAL. Default is 1024.
	Roughly equals to the maximum number of connections the server can handle.

- daemon.user

	String. OPTIONAL. Default is empty.
	Keyspace is running with this user if started as root for security reasons.
	
- database.dir

	Path. OPTIONAL. Default is '.'. BDB related.
	The directory where the BerkeleyDB files are stored. If you run  multiple
	instances on the same host, this must be different for all nodes.
	
	Example: /var/lib/keyspace

- database.pageSize

	Number < 65536. OPTIONAL. Default is 4096. BDB related.
	Set the page size (in bytes) in the backend database. Leave this alone
	unless you know what you're doing.

- database.cacheSize

	Number. OPTIONAL. Default is 100M.
	Set the cache size in backend database. This is related to how much
	memory Keyspace uses for caching.
	
	Example: 100M

- database.logBufferSize

	Number. OPTIONAL. Default is 2M. BDB related.
	Sets the buffer size for transaction logs.

- database.checkpointTimeout

	Number [msec]. OPTIONAL. Default is 60000 msec. BDB related.
	Database checkpointing occurs this often.
	
- database.numReaders

	Number. OPTIONAL. Default is 20.
	Number of threads used for transactional reads such as lists.

- database.verbose
	Boolean. OPTIONAL. Default is false. BDB related.
	Turns on BDB verbosity for debugging.

- keyspace.port

	Number. OPTIONAL. Default is 7080.
	The port of the Keyspace client protocol. If you run multiple instances
	on the same host, this must be different for all instances.

- http.port

	Number. OPTIONAL. Default is 8080.
	The port of the Keyspace HTTP server.  If you run multiple instances on
	the same host, this must be different for all instances.

- logCache.size

	Number. OPTIONAL. Default is 10000.
	The number of Paxos rounds cached.

- logCache.maxMem

	Number. OPTIONAL. Default is 100M.
	Maximum memory allocated for Paxos log cache.

- log.trace

	Boolean. OPTIONAL. Default is false.
	Whether to print out debug traces.

- log.targets

	List of strings. OPTIONAL. Default is stdout. Options are stdout, file and syslog.
	More than one can be given, seperated with commas.
	
	Example: stdout, file, syslog
	
- log.file

	Path. OPTIONAL. Default is none.
	The path of the log file to use if log.targets = file is given.
	
- log.timestamping

	Boolean. OPTIONAL. Default is false.
	Whether to put a timestamp in front of log messages.


Firewall & ports info
=====================

Keyspace uses several ports to communicate with other nodes. These are
the following, with relative offset to the Paxos port (see 'Configuration
options', paxos.endpoints regarding configuration of the Paxos port).

============== =================
port offset     name
============== =================
0               Paxos (tcp)
1               PaxosLease (udp)
2               Catchup (tcp)
============== =================

Eg. if you have nodes with Paxos port on 10000/tcp, you need
to open the following ports on your firewall: 

10000/tcp, 10001/udp, 10002/tcp

In addition the server ports, you need to open the client protocol
ports too (see 'Configuration options': http.port, keyspace.port).
